# Android fundamentals 01.2 Part A: Your first interactive UI

### sp

The `sp` stands for *scale-independent pixel*, and like `dp`, is a unit that scales with the screen density and user's font size preference. Use dp units when you specify font sizes so that the sizes are adjusted for both the screen density and the user's preference.

**(Adaptive length unit, which varys according to screen density)**



### Attr android:gravity

`gravity`: The `gravity` attribute specifies how a `View` is aligned within its *parent* `View` or `ViewGroup`. In this step, you center the `TextView` to be centered vertically within the parent `ConstraintLayout`

**(For view aligning)**



### Prevent using hard-coding string in views' text attr

**It would bring inconvinence when your App come to internationalization**

Use string res (@string) instead for flexibility

>  Having the strings in a separate file makes it easier to manage them, especially if you use these strings more than once. Also, string resources are mandatory for translating and localizing your app, because you need to create a string resource file for each language.

> In short, while Python allows you to feed a few commands directly into the interpreter to test out an algorithm, working with Java requires you to place that code in context.
